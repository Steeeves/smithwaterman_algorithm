# Smith-Waterman Algorithm
Program in Python3 that implements Smith-Waterman algorithm based on the blosum50 scoring matrix.
Made for IST Computational Biology subject 2020/2021.

## Requirements
requires the following libraries:
- os
- Bio.SubsMat (https://biopython.org/wiki/Download)
- time

## Usage
1º insert the first amino acid sequence in all caps lock;

2º insert the second amino acid sequence in all caps lock;

3º insert the gap penalty (the program will always consider the integer as negative);

4º outputs the solution(s) with the sequences where the best local combination is highlighted, the value of the best combination and the time it took to execute.

## Credits
Program made by Francisco Esteves.

Tested by Diogo Gonçalves, Clémentine and Gonçalo Damas.
